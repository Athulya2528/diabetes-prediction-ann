This implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow (Keras) to predict diabetes based on medical diagnostic features from a structured dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, train–test splitting, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and building a feedforward neural network with ReLU-activated hidden layers and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function and evaluated on unseen test data. It achieves a test accuracy of 74.67%, indicating moderate predictive performance and effective learning of non-linear relationships in the data. The project serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of ANN-based classification in a healthcare context.
